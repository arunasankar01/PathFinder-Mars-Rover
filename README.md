# PathFinder Project

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project appears to be the creation of a web-based visualization tool for pathfinding algorithms used in navigating a Mars Rover or similar scenarios. The tool seems to allow users to interactively select different pathfinding algorithms and their options, visualize the algorithm's execution on a grid, and control the simulation.

## Implementation Overview:

***HTML Structure***: The HTML file defines the structure of the user interface, including buttons, panels, and sections for selecting algorithms and their respective options. It also includes placeholders for visualizing the grid and displaying statistics.

***JavaScript Components***: The various referenced JavaScript files (view.js, controller.js, panel.js, main.js) contain the logic and functionality for implementing the pathfinding algorithms, handling user interactions, controlling the simulation, and updating the UI elements accordingly.

***Libraries and Dependencies***: The project utilizes several libraries and dependencies such as jQuery, Raphael, State Machine, and a pathfinding library (pathfinding-browser.min.js). These libraries provide functionalities related to UI manipulation, graphics rendering, state management, and pathfinding algorithms.

***User Interaction***: The interface allows users to select different pathfinding algorithms like A*, Breadth-First-Search, Best-First-Search, and Dijkstra. Users can also toggle algorithm-specific options like heuristic functions and diagonal movement.
